# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Jonathan Chamberlin
- **What to call them:** Jonathan
- **Timezone:** EST (Northeastern University, Boston area)
- **Notes:** CS student at Northeastern (Khoury College). Working extremely hard toward career goals.

## Current Goal

Land a spring 2027 co-op/internship as an ML Engineer or Data Scientist at a top-tier company (Meta, Google, Amazon, OpenAI, Anthropic, Airbnb, Palantir). Build toward $270k/year total comp by May 2029.

## Target Roles
1. Machine Learning Engineer
2. ML Engineer (Recommendation Systems)
3. Data Scientist (Consumer)

## Weekly Schedule (19 hrs/week, no exceptions)
- Mon-Wed 12-3pm: Project work
- Thu 12-3pm: Networking
- Fri 12-3pm: HackerRank / LeetCode / DSA
- Sat 1-3pm: Research + Retrieval practice
- Sun 1-3pm: Catch-up buffer

## Current Phase
Phase 1 (Feb-Apr): Foundations + First Demo - Building a recommendation system with Two-Tower architecture on Goodreads-10K dataset. Ship as live demo with URL.

## Key Projects
1. **Recommendation System** (Phase 1) - Two-Tower model, PyTorch, FastAPI backend, React frontend, Goodreads-10K dataset
2. **Project #2** (Phase 2, May-Jul) - TBD ambitious ML project built with agentic workflows and OpenClaw

## Skills Prioritizing
Python (100%), PyTorch (78%), Distributed Systems/Spark (50%), A/B Testing (42%), Recommendation/Personalization (39%), Deep Learning (39%), SQL (33%)

## Rules Jonathan Follows
- Never cold apply - always get referrals first
- Learn top-down, not bottom-up
- Every project ships as live demo with URL
- Recursive gap filling on AI-generated code
- Active recall weekly
- System design > LeetCode
- Reach out to engineers, not recruiters

## What He's NOT Doing
No DS research track, no NLP/CV standalone study, no mathematical proofs, no TensorFlow/JAX, no heavy K8s, no video lectures, no textbooks cover-to-cover

## OpenClaw Goals
- Read and update (not delete) all platforms: files, Google Drive, Gmail, Calendar, GitHub, Notion, Telegram
- Automate posting on X, Instagram, LinkedIn (2 posts/week)
- Run 24/7 on a server
- Eventually build multi-agent swarms for project work
- Find ways to make money with automation
